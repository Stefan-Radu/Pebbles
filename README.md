# Pebbles
HackTheVirus Project


## Inspiration

The Rock, Pebbles, and Sand in a Jar Story. 

## What it does

Lack of motivation. Lack of inspiration. Lose of hope. Bad habits.

Those would be some of the big problems that people have been struggling with more than before in isolation. 

The aim of the app is to tackle exactly those problems and many more, to connect and inspire users through the use of something which will call pebbles.
 
A pebble at its core is just a title and some content that falls into (at the moment) 3 categories: activities, everyday tips and inspiration.

The possibilities are endless.

Users can stimulate each other by sharing workouts, music playlists, a great article, a blog post, a new hobby, recipes, quotes, healthy habits, some online shop where they managed to buy toilet paper and many many others.

Then each user can vote the best pebbles, which will result in those rising in popularity and reaching more users.

## How I built it

It is build using Flutter and FireBase as a backed.

## Challenges I ran into

Designing the application.
Learning how to user Firebase.
Relearning how to user Flutter.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Learned to user FireBase (somewhat)
Created my first application with a working backend.

## What I learned

Be smart before you work hard.

## What's next for Pebbles

* Ability for a user to change its data,
* Ability for a user to change/delete its own pebbles
* Being able to sort pebbles in different ways
* Show pebbles you voted for / your own pebbles (this I couldn't finish implementing)
* Implement a more elaborate way of voting a pebble
* Improve the design
* Remove unpopular/old pebbles
* More categories
* Ability to filter pebbles
* as pebbles get more votes they will change their type (example: sand grain -> simple rock -> iron ore -> amethyst crystal -> diamond)
* Ability to share pebbles

The backbone of the app is to be as simple as possible while having a great impact.
